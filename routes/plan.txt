Route planning:

-   Each file represents a table/ table group that will have the same set of routes
-   Each subject will need its own route and associated id
 



Tables: 

-   Categories: 
    -   Contains the subject info broken down into what was done each week
    -   e.g. Week 1 = JS, Week 4 = Node, Week 5 = Databases etc. 

-   Sub-categories
    -   Contains info on subjects that were covered each day within the week:
    -   e.g. Week 5 day 1 = intro to postgres, Week 5 day 3 = inner joins

-   User posts: 
    -   These need to be displayed on the main display at all times, depending on which subject category is selected
    -   Comments will need to have an id that relates to the subject they belong to i.e.: 
        {
        userId: int,
        postId: int,
        categoryId: int, - this is what we will reference when making a req to see all comments belonging to one category
        content: string,
        postTime: number,
        postDate: number}

-   User credential: 
    -   store the username and password of users
    -   hard coded in the beginning (stored in a lib.js file)
    -   {
        userId: int,
        username: string,
        password: string
        }
    -   Stretch goal is to use google auth
